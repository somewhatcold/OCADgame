### Art Assets
Assets or animations can be directly added to the project. For best practice, however, an upload of each asset should also be uploaded to the game-art google drive to ensure easy access and organization.

### Packages
Here there will be links to any Unity Packages or plug-ins which are used in the project and required when working on your own branch.
