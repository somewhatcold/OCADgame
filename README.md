# OCADgame

## IMPORTANT

THIS IS AN ARCHIVE OF THE OLD .MAIN BRANCH WHICH CONTAINED THE ORIGINAL UNITY PROTOTYPE. DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING IN THIS BRANCH OR PUSH CHANGES. THIS EXISTS ONLY AS AN ARCHIVE.

Thank you :D


## Basic Info
When working on this project, please work on your own seperate **<ins>branch</ins>** and create a **<ins>pull-request</ins>** before merging your changes to **MAIN** and ensuring there are no conflicts.


#### If unsure how to follow those guidelines, please feel free to ask anyone on the team for help or consult these resources: <br>

The main takeaway from this is to <ins>**NEVER WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH DIRECTLY UNLESS YOU HAVE TOLD THE TEAM!**</ins>

##### Branch naming convention:
[name] _ [BranchPurpose] --> ex. Elmo_NewPlayerAnimations

## Using Github Issues
When working on a new feature, bug-fixes, or any new additions to the project, it's best practice to open a ticket via the Github Issues tab in order to keep track of who is working on what, as well as where they are in the creation of it. Additionally, pull-requests can be linked to different issue tickets which makes the organzation of commits much easier as a whole.

## Art Assets
Assets or animations can be directly added to the project. For best practice, however, an upload of each asset should also be added to the game-art google drive or discord channel to ensure easy access and organization. 

<br>

## Packages
Here there will be links to any Unity Packages or plug-ins which are used in the project and required when working on your own branch.
