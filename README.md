## Basic Info
When working on this project, please work on your own seperate **<ins>branch</ins>** and create a **<ins>pull-request</ins>** before merging your changes to **MAIN** and ensuring there are no conflicts.

The main takeaway from this is to <ins>**NEVER WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH DIRECTLY UNLESS YOU HAVE TOLD THE TEAM!**</ins>

##### Branch naming convention:
[name] _ [BranchPurpose] --> ex. Janah_NewPlayerAnimations

## Using Github Issues
When working on a new feature, bug-fixes, or any new additions to the project, it's best practice to open a ticket via the Github Issues tab in order to keep track of who is working on what, as well as where they are in the creation of it. Additionally, pull-requests can be linked to different issue tickets which makes the organzation of commits much easier as a whole.

## Art Assets
Assets or animations can be directly added to the project. For best practice, however, an upload of each asset should also be added to the game-art google drive to ensure easy access and organization.

## Packages
Here there will be links to any Unity Packages or plug-ins which are used in the project and required when working on your own branch.
